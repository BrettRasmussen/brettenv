The files in this directory are config files for Karabiner, the OSX key-mapping
software.

Because I use a Kinesis keyboard and also do tons of stuff, including
vim editing, on the command line, life is a little tricky on OSX. Specifically,
I want both control keys on my keyboard to act as command keys in Mac in all
apps except the terminal. In that case, I want control keys to be control keys
but still need the command key for menu-item stuff like opening new windows and
tabs.

control_key.json remaps control to command in all apps except terminal. It also
maps caps_lock to be a command key while using terminal and a control key
everywhere else.

Any json file, including control_key.json, in this directory can be dropped into
~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications. That will create a new rule or
set of rules in the "add rule" dialog in the "Complex Modifications" tab in the
Karabiner config gui, called Karabiner Elements. Enable the desired rules and
the mappings should then work.

What actually happens at that moment is Karabiner merges the enabled json
configs into ~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json, the main config file for a
running Karabiner instance. Which means it's probably best to stick to separate
json files in assets/complex_modifications and simply enable or disable from the
gui.

private.xml is an old configuration file in the previous Karabiner format. It is
useless now, but it contains a whole bunch of config stuff I had to work out,
addressing some complex questions about what mappings had to be established in
what order to make it all function, and it can serve as a reference for what
might arise in the future. Thankfully, the new setup is much less complicated.
