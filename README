To get this working, the normal .bashrc file needs to have this line:

  alias brettenv='source ~/.brettenv/bashrc'

If this is your own home directory, also add the following immediately
thereafter to set it all up by default on login:
  
  brettenv

For other accounts you might have access to, such as root, you can symlink
.brettenv in that account's home directory to the one in your home directory and
add the "alias brettenv" line above to that user's normal .bashrc file.  Then
you can call brettenv once from the command line to set it all up.
