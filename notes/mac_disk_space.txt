When the mac runs out of disk space on its own, it's likely that a large part of that is because of
Mac's habit of caching things.

kernel_task and mds_stores are two things that come with Mac that do something of that nature. Some
of what kernel_task does appears to be swapping to disk when the machine is running hot, or
something like that. It might also be writing metadata for some resource-intensive processes or the
like. Hard to really know what all it's about without digging in more.

Whatever the cause, much of what gets written goes to /private/var/folders, so try this:

$ sudo su
$ cd /private/var/folders
$ du -hd 1

Then delete huge subdirectories, and probably reboot the machine.

In those subdirectories there will be a "C" directory, which is some sort of cache for some program.
Deleting the cache might mess up operations for the related program if it's running, but it should
be fine after that program restarts.

The reboot is because Mac does a good amount of cleaning up its own caches on reboot, so the
combination of clearing out those caches and rebooting should free up a bunch of space.

If the machine is running so slowly because it's already gotten to unusability due to lack of disk
space, just the reboot should clear up enough to start working with it again.
